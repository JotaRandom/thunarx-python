Thunarx Python Bindings

These bindings allow one to create python plugins for Thunar.

Install
-----------
To install, run the following commands:
  $ ./configure (or ./autogen.sh if building from git)
  $ make
  $ make install
  
If you have built thunar into a non-standard prefix, thunarx-python will be
installed there, but make sure pkg-config knows where it is.  You may have to 
update your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to include your thunar's 
pkgconfig path.

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/thunar_prefix/lib/pkgconfig"

Running Extensions
------------------
As of thunarx-python 0.3.0, scripts are loaded from $XDG_DATA_DIR/thunarx-python/extensions,
which includes ~/.local/share and /usr/share (or whatever your $XDG_DATA_DIR is 
set to).  Simply copy your python scripts into that folder and restart thunar.

Dependencies
------------
 * thunar (0.4.0 or later)
 * pygtk (2.6.0 or later)
 * pygobject (2.6.0 or later)
 * gnome-python (2.12.0 or later)
 
Debugging
-----------
To enable debug mode, start thunar with the following command:

  $ THUNARX_PYTHON_DEBUG=all /path/to/thunar
