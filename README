Thunarx Python Bindings

These bindings allow one to create python plugins for Thunar.

Install
-----------
To install, run the following commands:
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
  
If you have built thunar into a non-standard prefix, thunarx-python will be
installed there, but make sure pkg-config knows where it is.  You may have to 
update your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to include your thunar's 
pkgconfig path.

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/thunar/lib/pkgconfig"

Dependencies
------------
 * thunar (1.1 or later)
 * pygtk (2.6.0 or later)
 * pygobject (2.16 or later)
 * gnome-python (2.12.0 or later)
 
Debugging
-----------
To enable debug mode, start thunar with the following command:

  $ THUNARX_PYTHON_DEBUG=all /path/to/thunar
